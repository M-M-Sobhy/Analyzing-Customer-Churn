# Customer Churn Dashboard  

## 📌 Overview  
In this project, I used **Power BI** to create an interactive dashboard analyzing customer churn data.  
The goal is to identify patterns, reasons for churn, and customer behaviors to help the business **improve retention strategies**.  

The dashboard highlights KPIs such as:  
- Total Customers  
- Churn Rate  
- Number of Churned Customers  
- Breakdown of churn by **age, contract type, customer service calls, and geography**  

---

## 📊 Dataset  
The dataset contains telecom customer information, including:  
- Customer demographics (age, gender, senior status)  
- Contract details (monthly, yearly, two-year plans)  
- Billing & charges (monthly charges, extra data charges, international charges)  
- Customer service interactions  
- Churn status (Yes/No)
